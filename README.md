# Why?

As a beginner to the rust programming language, I build this basic console app to help me farmiliarize myself with the rust programming language and some of its important concepts like its type system, ownership and borrowership, lifetimes, closurs, etc.

I hope anybody who has tried learning rust but has not been able to put something together can take a look at this project and find inspiration.
